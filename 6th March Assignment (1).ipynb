    "Ans:- There are two types of  Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "  Descriptive statistics involves summarizing and describing data in a meaningful way. It provides numerical measures or visual representations\n",
    "  that help to understand and describe the main features of a dataset. Some common measures used in descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode, range, \n",
    "  standard deviation, and percentiles. Descriptive statistics are used to analyze and interpret data in a concise and informative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: Suppose you have a dataset containing the heights of students in a class. To understand the distribution of heights and describe\n",
    "        the central tendency of the data, you can calculate the mean height, median height, and standard deviation. \n",
    "        These descriptive statistics will provide insights into the typical height of the students and the variability within the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "   Inferential statistics involves drawing conclusions or making predictions about a population based on a sample of data.  \n",
    "   It uses probability theory and statistical inference techniques to make inferences about a larger population using limited information. \n",
    "   Inferential statistics allow researchers to generalize findings from a sample to a larger population and test hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Suppose you are interested in knowing the average income of all households in a city. \n",
    "            It is not feasible to survey every household, so you take a random sample of households and collect income data.\n",
    "            By using inferential statistics, you can estimate the average income of the entire population based on the sample data,\n",
    "            along with determining the confidence interval or conducting hypothesis tests to make statistical inferences about the population.\n",

    "Eye color: blue, green, brown\n",
    "Marital status: single, married, divorced\n",

    "2. Ordinal Data: Ordinal data represents categories with a natural order or ranking. The difference between the categories may not be equal,\n",
    "but there is a relative order. \n",
    "Examples of ordinal data include:\n",
    "Educational attainment: high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree\n",
    "Satisfaction level: very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interval Data: Interval data represents numerical data where the difference between values is meaningful,\n",
    "and zero represents a specific point on the scale but does not indicate an absence of the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interval data include:\n",
    "Temperature measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit\n",
    "Years (e.g., 1990, 2000, 2010)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ratio Data: Ratio data is similar to interval data but has a meaningful zero point that indicates the absence of the attribute.\n",
    "Ratio data have a natural order,\n",
    "equal intervals, and meaningful ratios between values. \n",
    "\n",

    "the type of statistical analysis that can be applied. Here's an explanation of each level along with an example variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Nominal Level: At the nominal level, variables are classified into distinct categories or groups without any inherent order or numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Gender (categories: male, female)\n",
    "Blood type (categories: A, B, AB, O)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ordinal Level: The ordinal level involves variables that have categories with a natural order or ranking, but the differences between the categories may not be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Educational attainment (categories: high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree)\n",
    "Satisfaction level (categories: very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Interval Level: The interval level of measurement includes variables where the differences between values are meaningful, and zero does not indicate an absence of the attribute.\n",
    "It also allows for the comparison of magnitudes and equal intervals between values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 20°C, 30°C)\n",
    "Years (e.g., 1990, 2000, 2010)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Ratio Level: The ratio level encompasses variables that possess all the properties of the interval level but also have a meaningful zero point indicating the absence of the attribute.\n",
    "Ratio variables allow for meaningful ratios and comparisons between values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Height in centimeters (e.g., 160 cm, 180 cm)\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's consider a dataset of customer satisfaction ratings for a product on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 represents \"Very dissatisfied\" and 5 represents \"Very satisfied.\" \n",
    "The variable in this case is \"customer satisfaction rating,\" and it falls under the ordinal level of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we mistakenly treat the satisfaction ratings as interval data, we may perform operations that assume equal intervals between the categories.\n",
    "For instance, we might calculate the average rating by summing up the ratings and dividing by the number of respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the variable is ordinal, treating it as interval data and calculating the average can lead to misleading results. \n",
    "The difference between a rating of 4 and 3 might not necessarily be the same as the difference between 3 and 2, as the intervals are not guaranteed to be equal.\n",
    "In this case, calculating the median or mode, which are appropriate measures for ordinal data, would provide more meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the level of measurement helps us choose the appropriate statistical analyses and measures of central tendency and dispersion that are suitable for the data.\n",

    "3.Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average distance between each data point and the mean.\n",
